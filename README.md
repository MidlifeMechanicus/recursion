# Project: Recursion
A project for the Odin Project Ruby Course

### Assignment

First up create a file and tackle the fibonacci sequence:

1. Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively.
3. Test both versions of your methods by passing in various lengths as arguments.

Once you have a firm grasp on solving Fibonacci with recursion, create a new file and work on a merge sort:

1. Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology. An input of [3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1] should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and an input of [105, 79, 100, 110] should return [79, 100, 105, 110].
